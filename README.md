# WinUI3Preview3_Problems_GridSplitter

This repository contains two solutions with sample code demonstrating the difference between the GridSplitter in UWP and WinUI3 Preview 3 Desktop.

The UWP sample code works as expected - as the user hovers over the GridSplitter the cursor changes to the Resize symbol. However, the in the WinUI3 Desktop sample code, the cursor does not change to the Resize cursor icon on the hover over or while adjusting the GridSplitter.
